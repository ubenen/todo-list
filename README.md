Hello, 
I'm Julia and I'm doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
I studied graphic and communications design, but then decided on computer science.
I'm actually just starting to use GitHub now.
I'm really excited to see what awaits me here...
(Many lines of code and comments are still written in German, for my better understanding - but in the future I will write them in English... I'm still a beginner.)
